# Client Proposal Generator
This Client Proposal Generator transforms client briefs into formatted PDF proposals. It uses a React/Tailwind CSS frontend, Django/PostgreSQL backend, and GPT-4 to scope requirements and generate structured proposals. Deployed via Docker/GitHub Actions/Railway, it includes templates, branding injection, and PDF export logic.
